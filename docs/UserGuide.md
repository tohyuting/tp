--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `CLI-nic.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-W14-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your CLI-nic system.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
  ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will
display instructions for the various commands. Typing `help delete` and pressing Enter will display in-depth
instructions for the `delete` command.<br>Here are some sample commands to try:

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) section below for more details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `delete ct/TYPE i/INDEX`, `TYPE` and `INDEX` are parameters which can be used as `delete ct/w i/1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional<br>
  e.g. `add ct/s n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL [r/REMARK]` can be used as:
  * `add ct/s n/Philips Pharmaceutical p/00000000 e/philipsPharm@gmail.com r/fast reply` or as
  * `add ct/s n/Philips Pharmaceutical p/00000000 e/philipsPharm@gmail.com`.<br>

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  * e.g. `[pd/PRODUCT_NAME…​]` can be used as `pd/panadol`, `pd/panadol needle syringe` and so on.
  * Note that only **one prefix is used with multiple keywords** if necessary.<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If multiple arguments with the same prefix are present in the input, and if all the values are valid, only the last
  prefix value is chosen. <br>
  e.g. if a user enters `n/Alice n/Bob` where both `Alice` and `Bob` are valid, no error will be thrown. Instead, the
  name `Bob` will be used instead of `Alice`.

* Usage of irrelevant prefixes or forward slashes `/` are not allowed by default except when the user chooses to
  define it in their assigned Macro commands.<br>
  e.g. `delete ct/TYPE i/INDEX pd/PRODUCT_NAME` can be used as `delete ct/pw i/1 pd/Panadol` but not
  `delete ct/pw i/1 pd/Panadol r/Fast relief` nor `delete ct/pw i/1 pd/Panadol/Panadol Strong`.

* For single word commands that do not take in arguments such as `clear`, `list`, `redo` and `undo`, trailing keywords
  after the command word will be ignored.

* All command words and prefixes are case-sensitive, except for `COMMAND` parameter in `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Displays a list of available commands and their utility descriptions.
Narrows down to a specific command and its input format and sample commands if specified.
The link to the user guide can also be accessed by pressing F1. Note that an active Internet connection is needed to
view the user guide.

  ![help](images/helpAddMessage.png)

### Accessing command history

Accesses valid commands that have been previously used.<br>
Use the &#8593; and &#8595; keys on the keyboard to iterate through the command history.
Note that all valid commands will be stored in the command history, including duplicates.

### Adding a supplier : `add`

Adds a supplier to the CLI-nic application.

Format: `add ct/s n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL [r/REMARK]`

* `NAME` should start with an alphanumeric character.
* `PHONE` should not have a spacing in between. `p/98761234` is allowed, but `p/9876 1234` is not allowed.
   Only numbers are allowed.
* To add a product to a supplier, refer to the
  [update supplier](#updating-the-quantity-andor-tags-of-a-product-sold-by-a-supplier-update) section for more
  details.

Example:
* `add ct/s n/Philips Pharmaceutical p/00000000 e/philipsPharm@gmail.com r/Largest contractor` : Adds a supplier
  named `Philips Pharmaceutical` with the phone number `00000000` and email `philipsPharm@gmail.com`.
  This supplier is the `Largest contractor`.
  ![add](images/addSupplier.png)

### Adding a warehouse : `add`

Adds a warehouse to the CLI-nic application.

Format: `add ct/w n/NAME p/PHONE addr/ADDRESS [r/REMARK]`

* `NAME` should start with an alphanumeric character.
* `PHONE` should not have a spacing in between. `p/98761234` is allowed, but `p/9876 1234` is not allowed.
   Only numbers are allowed.
* To add a product to a warehouse, refer to the
  [update warehouse](#updating-the-quantity-andor-tags-of-a-product-stored-in-a-warehouse-update) section for more
  details.

Example:
* `add ct/w n/WarehouseA p/00000000 addr/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/First warehouse` : Adds a warehouse
  named `WarehouseA` located at `John street, block 123, #01-01` with the phone number `00000000`. This warehouse is
  the `First warehouse`.
  ![add](images/addWarehouse.png)

### Assigning macro to selected command string: `assignmacro`

Assigns a macro that pairs the specified alias to the specified command string.
This is especially useful for running commands that need to be used frequently.
By assigning a command string to an alias, users can enter the alias keyword instead of the command string to run
the same command (along with any additional prefixes supplied).

Format:	`assignmacro a/ALIAS cs/COMMAND_STRING`

* `ALIAS` cannot be an existing command word such as `add`, `delete` etc.
* `ALIAS` cannot be already used for an existing macro.
* `ALIAS` should only consist of alphanumeric characters and/or underscores (case-sensitive).
* `COMMAND_STRING` can consist of any number of prefixes (can be a partial command), but the first word has to be a pre-defined command word.
* `COMMAND_STRING` cannot take in another `assignmacro` command e.g.
  `assignmacro a/asgmac cs/assignmacro a/asgmac ...` as this is recursive.
* Even if the macro is valid, running the macro does not guarantee a valid command.

Examples:

* `assignmacro a/findsup cs/find ct/s pd/panadol` : Assigns a macro that pairs the alias `findsup` to the command
  string `find ct/s pd/panadol`. With this macro set up, users can now enter `findsup` instead of
  `find ct/s pd/panadol` to find the relevant supplier(s).
  ![assign macro](images/assignMacroFullCommand.png)

* `assignmacro a/uwp cs/update ct/w pd/panadol t/fever` : Assigns a macro that pairs the alias `uwp` to the
  command string `update ct/w pd/panadol t/fever`. Note that this is just a partial command string.
  With this macro set up, users can now enter `uwp i/1 q/123` instead of
  `update ct/w i/1 pd/panadol q/123 t/fever` to update the quantity for the `Panadol` product under the
  first warehouse from the list of displayed warehouses in the GUI to `123`.

### Autocomplete

Helps users complete their commands faster with the compulsory prefixes.

Users will be able to see a list of autocomplete options which is constantly updated while typing.
Once the autocomplete context menu is displayed, users can use the arrow keys to choose the option that they desire
and upon pressing Enter, they will be able to select the autocomplete option.

Example:

* User enters "add" in the command box and a list of autocomplete options is displayed.
  ![autocomplete](images/autocomplete.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

The `view` command is optimised for users who prefer to use the keyboard.

Using the `view` command, users can view the products associated with a specific supplier or warehouse without needing
to use the mouse.

Alternatively, users can click on the products pane in the GUI using the mouse to view the products associated.

Users might also find it useful to use the `view` command in conjunction with the `find` command.
</div>
